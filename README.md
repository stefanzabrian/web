# Online Shop & Business Management

Java Web App used for managing a business operations on products and projects
## Project Description


Online Shop & Business Operations Management.
In this application our user is split in two, one part is Client view and the second is Master.
As Client perspective I am looking for being able to visit the main page,
to see all products, register & have access to log in.
Once I am a Client I can buy any product, place an order, update an order or my own user information and log out.
Diving deeper into roles we add one more role with Update Authorizations and Read, we call it Moderator(employee).
This role will have access to Projects and their Tasks, he will update & work on tasks to complete more projects.
Any other requests are forbidden. Master/Admin role adds more authorizations for user: CRUD master on all entities.
